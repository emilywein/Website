            <div class="content"><p>I am currently a first year student at Carnegie Mellon University. My work highlights minimalist designs that attempt to maximize natural light as well as incorperate natural resources into the design. In my work, I am passionate about being environmentally friendly and finding ways to incorporate nature.</p>
            <p>
            With a history of photography, I have an appreciation for framing spaces and creating open and visually pleasing spaces.</p>
            <p>Outside of architecture, I like to explore other forms of artistic activities. My other interests include photography, dance, and music.I worked for a photography website for three summers and have some of my work published on their site (ice-dance.com). I have also been involved in my school'd dance team, Dancer's Symposium, and have taught several open classes.</p>
